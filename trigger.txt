FORCE RAILWAY REDEPLOY - 2025-07-09
- CRITICAL FIX: Resolve "Response validation failed - detected MP4 data" error
- Enhanced Railway service to validate JSON responses and prevent MP4 data corruption
- Improved proxy validation with explicit MP4 magic byte detection
- Added comprehensive logging to trace response flow and identify issues
- Railway service now uses res.json() instead of res.send() for guaranteed JSON handling
- Proxy now provides detailed error messages for debugging MP4 validation failures

This deployment should completely resolve the production MP4 detection errors.
